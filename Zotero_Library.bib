  abstract = {We investigated the occurrence of, and relationships among, snags and cavity-nesting birds in the rapidly urbanizing region around Seattle, Washington in 2001 and 2002. We measured the density of snags in 49 sites (1-km2 "suburban landscapes" that included built and forested portions), and determined the diameter, height, decay status, and species of individual snags. We spot-mapped territories and observed nests of cavity-nesting birds at a stratified, random subsample of 13 sites. Snags, especially red alder (Alnus rubra), were abundant in sites' forested portions, but rare in the built portions. Snag density was positively correlated with density of live trees. Snags in built versus forested portions were similar in all attributes except decay, which was more advanced in forested areas. In the oldest suburbs (60-80 years old), snags in forested portions were larger, more decayed, and more likely to have broken tops than those in younger suburbs (2-20 years old). Cavity-nesting bird species richness and equity of individuals per species was highest in suburban landscapes where remaining forest was not fragmented, but adjacent to highly intermixed urban and urban-forest land covers. Suburban landscapes with highly interspersed land covers had higher densities of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), Red-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta canadensis), Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) and Downy Woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens); suburban landscapes with higher percentages of forest had higher densities of Brown Creepers (Certhia americana), Chestnut-backed Chickadees (Poecile rufescens), Pileated (Dryocopus pileatus) and Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus). Red-breasted Sap-sucker (Sphyrapicus ruber) densities were positively correlated only with the density of snags. All study sites had low bird densities compared to wildlands, presumably due to the relative lack of live trees and snags. Cavity-nesting birds bred successfully in all landscapes; seven of the nine species produced fledglings in {$>$}50\% of their nesting attempts. Snags important for nesting were larger in diameter, taller, and more decayed than expected based on availability. Snags with active nests also had evidence of previous use, fungal conks, broken tops, and substantial bark. /// Durante el 2001 y 2002, investigamos la presencia de, y la \$relaci\textbackslash acute\{o\}n\$ entre, troncos muertos y aves que nidifican en cavidades en los alrededores de Seattle (Washington), una regi\'on que \$est\textbackslash acute\{a\} urbaniz\textbackslash acute\{a\}ndose r\textbackslash acute\{a\}pidamente\$. Medimos la densidad de troncos en 49 sitios (1-km2 de "paisajes suburbanos" que incluyeron ambientes edificados y bosques) y determinamos el \$di\textbackslash acute\{a\}metro\$, altura, estado de \$descomposici\textbackslash acute\{o\}n\$ y especie de troncos individuales. Mapeamos los territorios mediante registros puntuales y observamos los nidos de aves que nidifican en cavidades en una sub-muestra estratificada y al azar de 13 sitios. Los troncos, especialmente de Alnus rubra, fueron abundantes en las \'areas con bosque, pero raros en las \'areas edificadas. La densidad de troncos se \$correlacion\textbackslash acute\{o\}\$ positivamente con la densidad de \$\textbackslash acute\{a\}rboles\$ vivos. Los troncos de las areas edificadas y de las \'areas con bosque fueron similares en todos sus atributos excepto en su \$descomposici\textbackslash acute\{o\}n\$, que fue m\'as avanzada en los sitios boscosos. En los suburbios m\'as viejos (60-80 a\~nos), los troncos en las \'areas con bosque fueron m\'as grandes, estuvieron m\'as descompuestos y presentaron mayor probabilidad de tener sus extremos rotos que aquellos presentes en los suburbios m\'as nuevos (2-20 a\~nos). La riqueza de especies que nidifican en cavidades y la equitatividad de individuos por especie fueron mayores en los paisajes suburbanos donde el bosque remanente no estaba fragmentado, sino adyacente a coberturas con una gran mezcla de sitios urbanos y sitios en la \$transici\textbackslash acute\{o\}n\$ bosque-ciudad. Los paisajes suburbanos con coberturas ampliamente entremezcladas presentaron mayores densidades de Poecile atricapillus, Sitta canadensis, Colaptes auratus y Picoides pubescens; los paisajes suburbanos con porcentajes m\'as altos de bosque presentaron mayores densidades de Certhia americana, Poecile rufescens, Dryocopus pileatus y Picoides villosus. Las densidades de Sphyrapicus ruber \$s\textbackslash acute\{o\}lo\$ se correlacionaron positivamente con la densidad de troncos. Todos los sitios de estudio tuvieron bajas densidades de aves comparados con \'areas silvestres, debido presumiblemente a la carencia relativa de \$\textbackslash acute\{a\}rboles\$ vivos y troncos. Las aves que nidifican en cavidades criaron con \$\textbackslash acute\{e\}xito\$ en todos los paisajes; siete de las nueve especies produjeron volantones en {$>$}50\% de sus intentos de nidificaci\'on. Los troncos importantes para nidificar fueron m\'as grandes en \$di\textbackslash acute\{a\}metro\$ y altura y estuvieron m\'as descompuestos que lo esperado con \$relaci\textbackslash acute\{o\}n\$ a su disponibilidad. Los troncos con nidos activos \$tambi\textbackslash acute\{e\}n\$ presentaron evidencias de uso previo, deformaciones producidas por hongos, copas rotas y bastante corteza.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity forecasts are important for conservation, management, and evaluating how well current models characterize natural systems. While the number of forecasts for biodiversity is increasing, there is little information available on how well these forecasts work. Most biodiversity forecasts are not evaluated to determine how well they predict future diversity, fail to account for uncertainty, and do not use time-series data that captures the actual dynamics being studied. We addressed these limitations by using best practices to explore our ability to forecast the species richness of breeding birds in North America. We used hindcasting to evaluate six different modeling approaches for predicting richness. Hindcasts for each method were evaluated annually for a decade at 1,237 sites distributed throughout the continental United States. All models explained more than 50\% of the variance in richness, but none of them consistently outperformed a baseline model that predicted constant richness at each site. The best practices implemented in this study directly influenced the forecasts and evaluations. Stacked species distribution models and ``naive'' forecasts produced poor estimates of uncertainty and accounting for this resulted in these models dropping in the relative performance compared to other models. Accounting for observer effects improved model performance overall, but also changed the rank ordering of models because it did not improve the accuracy of the ``naive'' model. Considering the forecast horizon revealed that the prediction accuracy decreased across all models as the time horizon of the forecast increased. To facilitate the rapid improvement of biodiversity forecasts, we emphasize the value of specific best practices in making forecasts and evaluating forecasting methods.},

  abstract = {Aim To infer the biogeographical history of the avian clade Paridae (tits and chickadees) using methods based on discrete, a priori defined, geographical areas and a method that uses actual species distributions and a relaxed random walk in a Bayesian context. We compared their relative performances and how different area codings influenced the outcome in the discrete analyses. Location Holarctic, Indomalaya, Afrotropics. Methods The phylogeny was reconstructed using Bayesian inference and time-calibrated using published substitution rates and a fossil calibration point. The discrete analyses were performed in BioGeoBEARS. For the probabilistic diffusion analysis, the extant distribution of each species was shaped as polygons in Google Earth and analysed together with the posterior distribution of time-calibrated trees in beast. The diffusion process was modelled as a relaxed random walk. Results The earliest divergences occurred between 10 and 15 Ma and the probabilistic diffusion analysis, and one of the discrete analyses indicated that the parids originated in the mountains of East Asia (Sino-Himalayas). Due to a different categorization of the geographical areas, a partly overlapping but conceptually different region was indicated in the second discrete analysis. Between 8 and 5 Ma parids started to spread from the Sino-Himalayas and became established in North America and Africa before 5 Ma. However, the inferred dispersal patterns differed between the analyses. Main conclusion Overall, the analyses were congruent and together with the divergence time analysis provided a solid biogeographical history for the parids. However, some discrepancies were evident and the diffusion analysis often indicated a more stationary pattern in the Sino-Himalayas in contrast to the more widespread ancestors indicated by the discrete analyses. The discrete analyses were influenced both by the biogeographical model and delimitation of the a priori areas.},

  abstract = {Citizen science data are valuable for addressing a wide range of ecological research questions, and there has been a rapid increase in the scope and volume of data available. However, data from large-scale citizen science projects typically present a number of challenges that can inhibit robust ecological inferences. These challenges include: species bias, spatial bias, and variation in effort. To demonstrate addressing key challenges in analysing citizen science data, we use the example of estimating species distributions with data from eBird, a large semi-structured citizen science project. We estimate two widely applied metrics of species distributions: encounter rate and occupancy probability. For each metric, we assess the impact of data processing steps that either degrade or refine the data used in the analyses. We also test whether differences in model performance are maintained at different sample sizes. Model performance improved when data processing and analytical methods addressed the challenges arising from citizen science data. The largest gains in model performance were achieved with: 1) the use of complete checklists (where observers report all the species they detect and identify); and 2) the use of covariates describing variation in effort and detectability for each checklist. Occupancy models were more robust to a lack of complete checklists and effort variables. Improvements in model performance with data refinement were more evident with larger sample sizes. Here, we describe processes to refine semi-structured citizen science data to estimate species distributions. We demonstrate the value of complete checklists, which can inform the design and adaptation of citizen science projects. We also demonstrate the value of information on effort. The methods we have outlined are also likely to improve other forms of inference, and will enable researchers to conduct robust analyses and harness the vast ecological knowledge that exists within citizen science data.},
